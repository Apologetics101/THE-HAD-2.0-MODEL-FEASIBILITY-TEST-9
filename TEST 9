Would All Argon Escape from Minerals in the HAD 2.0 Model Due to Accelerated Nuclear Decay?

To address the critics’ concern regarding the escape of argon from minerals in the context of accelerated nuclear decay as described in the HAD 2.0 model, let's break down the key points and evaluate the plausibility of this claim.

Key Concepts:

Argon in Minerals:

Argon (Ar) is a noble gas, and it is often found in minerals in trace amounts, primarily as a result of the decay of potassium-40 (K-40) into argon-40 (Ar-40) through radioactive decay. This process is part of radiometric dating and occurs 
over millions of years under normal conditions.

In solid minerals, particularly potassium-rich minerals, argon becomes trapped as a product of the decay of K-40, especially in volcanic rocks where the minerals solidify from magma.

Escape of Argon:

Argon is a noble gas, which means it is chemically inert and does not easily form compounds. It can escape from minerals if the mineral structure is disrupted or if the temperature becomes high enough to allow the gas to diffuse out.

Temperature and Pressure: When temperature increases, especially to the extent that is predicted in the HAD 2.0 model (due to accelerated nuclear decay), it can cause minerals to release their trapped gases (like argon). 
The activation energy needed for the argon to escape depends on the mineral type and the degree of heating.

Effect of Accelerated Nuclear Decay:

The HAD 2.0 model proposes that accelerated nuclear decay (due to factors like increased ionization and pressure within the Earth) could generate large amounts of heat, possibly sufficient to alter the decay rates of radioisotopes like potassium-40. 
This would result in higher-than-normal levels of argon being produced, potentially increasing the amount of argon trapped in minerals.

However, accelerated nuclear decay would also increase the temperature of the Earth’s interior, especially near the source of the decay (e.g., near tectonic plates, where heat is generated by subduction and volcanic activity).

Key Mechanisms Affecting Argon Release:

1. Temperature Effects on Minerals:

Heating due to accelerated nuclear decay could cause mineral structures to weaken and lead to the release of argon. However, the amount of heat needed to cause the minerals to release all the argon trapped inside them would depend on the specific mineral 
composition and the thermal history of the rock.

Argon release typically occurs at temperatures ranging from 500°C to 1300°C, depending on the type of mineral (e.g., feldspar or mica).

In the case of a global heat surge due to accelerated nuclear decay, the Earth's upper layers and minerals may reach these temperatures. While this would accelerate the release of argon, it does not necessarily mean that all argon would escape immediately.

2. Pressure Effects:

Pressure also plays a role in the retention of argon in minerals. While high pressure (from tectonic forces) can sometimes trap gases in minerals, extreme volcanic eruptions or tectonic movements could potentially release these gases if the pressure is reduced 
during volcanic events.

3. Geological and Volcanic Processes:

Volcanic eruptions driven by tectonic movements could lead to the release of argon into the atmosphere as magma rises to the surface and minerals melt. This would be a gradual process, as argon would be released from minerals within the magma during its ascent 
and eruption.

The rapid tectonic movements and volcanism proposed in the HAD 2.0 model would release argon, but only from the minerals that are actively involved in the volcanic activity or from the rocks that are being disturbed.

Can All Argon Escape?

It’s unlikely that all argon would escape from minerals, even in the case of accelerated nuclear decay. The following reasons support this conclusion:

Incomplete Release: While elevated temperatures and tectonic activity could increase argon release, it would not necessarily result in complete expulsion. Some minerals may retain argon, especially if the heat is not sustained at levels high enough to release 
all of it, or if the gas remains trapped in minerals that are not actively involved in volcanism.

Continued Subduction and Recycling: Tectonic subduction could result in the recycling of minerals. Even if argon escapes from some minerals during volcanic eruptions, the Earth’s recycling process could allow some argon to remain trapped in newly forming minerals 
or deep within the mantle, where temperatures may not be sufficient to release it entirely.

Dynamic Processes: The Earth's geological processes are complex, and while accelerated decay and volcanic activity would certainly release some of the argon, it is unlikely that all argon in Earth's minerals would escape, especially over the course of a single year. 
Some argon could still remain trapped in lower layers of the Earth, protected from the most intense heat.

Conclusion: Is It True That All Argon Would Escape?

No, it is not true that all argon would escape from minerals in the HAD 2.0 model due to accelerated nuclear decay. While accelerated decay and the associated heating and volcanic activity would increase the release of argon from some minerals, the amount of argon 
that escapes would likely be partial, not total. The Earth’s mineral composition, along with the pressure and thermal history of specific rocks, would prevent the complete escape of argon.

Additionally, geological processes like subduction and mineral recycling would ensure that some of the argon remains within the Earth, even if large amounts of gas are released during volcanic events. Therefore, the presence of argon in minerals would still be a 
valid indicator of past decay processes, but complete escape is unlikely under the conditions described in the HAD 2.0 model.
